-Opening background information(내 프로젝트의 전반적인 문맥을 위해서 필요!)
Vehicle detection is a computer vision technology that identifies and locates various types of vehicles, such as cars, trucks, and buses, in camera footage or images. This technology plays a crucial role in applications like traffic management, autonomous driving, parking systems, and security surveillance.
-General description of the current porject(프로젝트의 전반적인 설명)
Speeding occurs when a vehicle travels faster than the legally allowed speed limit. It is a common traffic violation that can lead to accidents, fines, and penalties. Detecting speeding helps improve road safety and enforce traffic regulations.
-Proposed idea for enhancements to the project(제안하고 싶은 프로젝트의 강점)
Develop a web-based dashboard for live monitoring and historical data analysis.
-Value and significance of this project(중요성)
Data-Driven Policy Making:Real-time and historical data allow governments and traffic authorities to improve traffic policies and plan infrastructure effectively.
-Current limitations(직면하고 있는 한계)
Automation and Cost Reduction:Replacing manual monitoring with an automated vehicle detection system reduces operational costs and human errors.
-Literature review(전반적인 프로젝트의 배경지식 공유를 위해서!)
Traffic Systems and Smart Cities:Edge Computing:
For vehicle recognition systems requiring real-time processing, edge computing technology is being used to analyze and process data locally before transmitting it to the cloud, enabling faster analysis and reducing latency.
